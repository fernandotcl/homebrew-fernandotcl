Those are my [Homebrew][] formulae. Those formulae aren't part of mainline Homebrew or have been modified for my personal use. You may use them through [Homebrew taps][taps] or pick only the ones that you need.

[homebrew]: http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/
[taps]: https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/wiki/Homebrew-0.9

## Usage

If you'd like to tap into this repository, something like this may suffice:

```sh
$ brew tap fernandotcl/homebrew-fernandotcl
```

Then install the formulae you want. See `brew(1)` for more information.

## Credits

These formulae were created by [Fernando Tarl√° Cardoso Lemos][fernando].
