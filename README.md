[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/fernandotcl/homebrew-fernandotcl/_apis/build/status/fernandotcl.homebrew-fernandotcl?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/fernandotcl/homebrew-fernandotcl/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)

Those are my [Homebrew][] formulae. Those formulae aren't part of mainline Homebrew or have been modified for my personal use. You may use them through [Homebrew taps][taps] or pick only the ones that you need.

## Usage

If you'd like to tap into this repository, something like this may suffice:

```sh
$ brew tap fernandotcl/homebrew-fernandotcl
```

Then install the formulae you want. See `brew(1)` for more information.

## Credits

These formulae were created by [Fernando Tarl√° Cardoso Lemos][fernando].
